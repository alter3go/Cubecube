*A tangible CAD interface.*

To learn about how to build the Cubecube hardware that accompanies this software, [check out the Cubecube instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Cubecube-A-Tangible-CAD-Interface/). From our instructable's description:

>__Cubecube__—an open-source hardware project—is a tangible, tactile interface for CAD (computer-aided drafting.) As open source design platforms continue to emerge, there is an opportunity to explore new possibilities in how we create. The Cubecube project aims to investigate the question: If there were a platform for using your hands to build three-dimensional computer models, what might it look like?

We also have [a website](https://cubecu.be/) where you can track this project as it progresses.
